# Happy_Healthy_Habits
Educational health game geared toward kids to educate them early on about healthier foods and calorie intake. There are five rounds and in each round players are given a choice to pick between a healthy and non-healthy choice; each choice has a description of the heatlh aspects of that choice. There is a health bar that increases every time a healthy choice is made and decreases every time a bad choice is made. Additionally, every time a healthy choice is made players will see happy Bricksy while every time an unhealthy choice is made players will see angry Bricksy.
