# Rules
The goal of this game is for players to keep the cute little avatar Bricksy alive by feeding him the healthier food option. There are five rounds and in each round players are given a choice to pick between a healthy and non-healthy choice; each choice has a description of its heatlh aspects. There is a health bar that increases every time a healthy choice is made and decreases every time a bad choice is made. Additionally, every time a healthy choice is made players will see happy Bricksy while every time an unhealthy choice is made players will see angry Bricksy. If the health bar is depleted before the last round the game will automaticallly end.
